Here are specific details and issues related to the infrastructure:

    Servers, functioning as computers, deliver services to other computers via a network.
    Domain names serve to identify websites and enhance user recollection of website addresses.
    The www record, a CNAME record, directs to the domain name.
    Nginx, the web server, acts as a reverse proxy, transferring requests to the application server.
    The application server houses the code base and manages requests from the web server.
    The database stores application data and awaits requests from the application server on a designated port.
    The server employs the HTTP protocol for communication with users' computers.
    A single point of failure (SPOF) exists in the infrastructure, meaning a system-wide halt if any component malfunctions. Additionally, maintenance tasks like code deployment or web server restarts necessitate downtime.
    The infrastructure lacks scalability in the face of heavy incoming traffic.

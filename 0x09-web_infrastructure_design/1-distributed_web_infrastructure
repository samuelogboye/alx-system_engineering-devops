Here are some specific details concerning this infrastructure:

    To enhance performance and reliability, we are introducing two new servers. This addition will distribute the workload across multiple machines and offer backup capabilities in case of hardware issues.

    The load balancer, HAproxy, is set up with a round-robin distribution algorithm. This algorithm evenly allocates incoming requests across all operational servers.

    The load balancer implements an Active-Passive configuration. This entails one server being actively engaged in processing incoming requests, while the other remains passive, ready to take over if the active server malfunctions.

    The database follows a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster model. This consists of a primary node managing write requests and several replica nodes handling read requests. Changes made on the primary node are instantly replicated to the replica nodes.

    Write requests are directed to the primary node, while read requests should be directed to any of the replica nodes.

However, there exist certain issues within this infrastructure:

    A single point of failure remains unresolved, which is the load balancer. If the load balancer experiences a malfunction, the entire system becomes inaccessible.

    Security concerns are evident, given the absence of a firewall and HTTPS encryption.

    Lack of real-time monitoring means that the system lacks the ability to promptly identify and address emerging problems.

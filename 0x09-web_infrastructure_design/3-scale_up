Here are the rationales for introducing each additional element into this infrastructure:

    Load Balancer (HAproxy):
        Reason: Implemented for effective load distribution across multiple Application Servers.
        Benefit: Enhances system efficiency, prevents server overload, and mitigates the risk of downtime.

    Dedicated Application Servers:
        Reason: Established to isolate application logic, thus improving performance and resource management.
        Benefit: Yields heightened stability and responsiveness of the application.

    Component Separation:
        Reason: Introduced for augmented security and simplified maintenance by segmenting components.
        Benefit: Diminishes the attack surface and enables targeted updates and troubleshooting.

    Application Files Replication:
        Reason: Implemented to ensure redundancy and availability in the event of server failures.
        Benefit: Reduces downtime by permitting alternative servers to handle application services.

    Shared Database (MySQL):
        Reason: Adopted for centralized data storage and uniformity across both Application Servers.
        Benefit: Averts data inconsistencies and guarantees uniform access.

    Load Balancer Cluster:
        Reason: Created to achieve high availability via a clustered load balancer setup.
        Benefit: Ensures uninterrupted services even in the face of load balancer failures.

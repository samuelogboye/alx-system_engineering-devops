Here are specific details about this infrastructure:

    Firewalls are implemented to safeguard servers from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. They filter and block harmful traffic that could potentially jeopardize server security.

    HTTPS is utilized to encrypt communication between the server and the client. This ensures data transmitted remains secure and inaccessible to third-party interception.

    Monitoring is employed to oversee server performance and promptly detect arising issues. Its purpose is to guarantee seamless server operation and prevent performance-affecting problems.

    Monitoring tools gather data by tracking various metrics such as CPU, memory, disk usage, and network activity. This data is then analyzed to identify potential issues.

    For monitoring web server QPS (Queries Per Second), tools like Apache JMeter or Gatling can be employed. These tools simulate user traffic, allowing measurement of server response time and QPS.

However, several issues are associated with this infrastructure:

    Terminating SSL at the load balancer level presents a concern as it exposes unencrypted traffic between the load balancer and web servers. This could pose a security risk in the presence of malicious actors on the network.

    Relying on a single MySQL server capable of accepting writes introduces a single point of failure. If this server becomes unavailable, the entire website goes down.

    The presence of servers with identical components (database, web server, and application server) can lead to issues. A failure in any one component would result in the entire website becoming inaccessible.
